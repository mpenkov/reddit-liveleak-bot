Besides my joint Ukrainian and Russian background I wanted both sides to see a different point of view of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was February 2006, I just got sent to the NCO (Non Commissioned Officer) Academy as a Specialist in the U.S. Army\nFor those of you not familiar with our rank and promotion system once you become a Sergeant you are required to attend the NCO Academy either prior and or after attaining your Rank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being stationed In Germany I was given a choice to go early, I just picked up my Specialist rank and they apparently needed a translator for a contingent of Russian soldiers going through the training with us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a kind of a exchange program of sorts to foster better relations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I go on a little about me. Half Ukrainian Half Russian, I had emigrated to the states in the early 90&amp;#39;s because of Chernobyl, I was born in Kiev originally and left the country when I was just 7 years old. My parents were both school teachers so I can read, speak, write Russian and Ukrainian fluently to this day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the American mid-west I enlisted right after 9/11 for all the hooah patriotic reasons my young teenage mind could come up with and actually got my American Citizenship via the US Army.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow moving on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We met the Russian soldiers near one of the installations Post Exchange shops at Grafenw\u00f6hr Germany. it was very snowy out and cold, but not too cold, I had my Army winter Fleece on and snivel gear, while the new arrivals were wearing and I hate to say it &amp;quot;Stereotypical&amp;quot; Eastern European outfit of either black jeans or dress pants, pointed leather shoes, and a leather jacket, -10C weather be damned. They were there to buy our PT Training uniforms for next days formation. It was the epitome of &amp;quot;East meets West&amp;quot; silent gazes abound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I broke the ice by asking in English if they can speak it. A few nodded yes, I then asked in crisp clear Russian if I could \ntranslate for them, a few surprised and shocked smiles peeked out. They realized since my last name ended in -enko on my name tape that I was Ukrainian, the Hohol jokes came forth but in a good natured way, they were impressed by my perfect Russian, and I \njokingly replied that I was busy trying to fit in to American Culture so i could debrief our KGB overlords back home, we all burst out laughing, things were off to a good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few hours later we were showing them the dining facility (Grafenw\u00f6hr Germany has THE FUCKING BEST Chow \nhall I have been too at the NCO academy.) The look on their faces when they came in and saw all of the fresh produce, \nfruit, vegetables and meat in the middle of winter for the taking. \nOne guy sheepishly asked if he could take an orange \nback with him, I told him why not, he can grab seconds too if he wanted. It definitely made me realize looking back seeing my parents and grandparents literally break down and cry the first time they went to a Supermarket back in America when we came stateside in the winter and seeing, fresh food, and meat and fruits, hell I didn&amp;#39;t even know what a goddamn Pineapple looked like until I saw one as a kid after coming to America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of these guys were volunteers under contract, not some of the regular conscript forces that get drafted up, these guys were Airborne Troops as well, mostly Infantry while the mix of soldiers at our NCO academy had everyone from a cook, to an Intel guy and a few combat arms specialties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the weeks went by I was able to say this, these guys were very professional, courteous, eager and willing to learn in the class room and out in the field. Yeah we had a few dick measuring contests of M1A1 Abrams vs the Soviet Tanks and Armor, and who has the better Jets, and firepower and weaponry but it was always with respect and humility. I recall discussing deployment stories of myself in Iraq and having to deal with Suicide bombers, some female, and having the Russian soldiers relate some pretty damn gritty war stories from Chechnya and having to deal with Muslim \nExtremists, a story of how one of their soldiers had both of his legs blown off by a landmine in a farmers field and \nhow their former PL ordered retribution by killing all of the Chechen sympathizers livestock and farm animals. Or how \nthey cornered a female Chechen sniper that ended up detonating herself as they approached her position in a high-rise building and how the soldier was covered in body parts and flesh and pieces of rubble. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These guys went through the same gritty in your face combat that I had just a year prior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It made me realize these guys have girlfriends, lovers, spouses, kids and parents at home that worry about them.\nThey try to make ends meet, not knowing when and where they will go too into harms way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of them made a quarter of the money I made and were able to still eek out a living. At that point in time I never thought 9 years later that they would be at war with the country I emigrated from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When January 7th Rolled around it was the first time I was able to celebrate Orthodox Christmas with others of my religion for the first time in years, (Usually when deployed I wouldn&amp;#39;t even bother, couldn&amp;#39;t get a chaplain out to where we were let alone a East Orthodox Christian one) it was nice just recalling some of the Russian traditions from my dads side of the family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered going out and buying a trinket and toy for one of the soldiers who&amp;#39;s wife was pregnant back home, the \nlook of surprise, and sheer joy on his face I will forever hold onto to this day. It was pure unadulterated happiness.\nWe got so hammered one evening with one of the actual Instructors from School it was right after New years and we went \nand got the Smirnoff Bottle at one of the German Shops, it was so fucking huge it had an actual Pump up top. Long \nstory short, Russians + Vodka = Tall tales of exploits to be had. By 0200 the American Instructor was so shit faced I had to stop drinking to make sure that I wouldn&amp;#39;t pass out so I could monitor his breathing, while the Russians \ncarefully carried his limp body onto his cot while another guy tried in hilarious broken English tell the Soldiers \nwife that he was just Drunk and sleeping it off as she kept buzzing his cellphone over and over again. &amp;quot;No Madam I said he iz Draunk, da, he iz as we say bohoi&amp;quot;. We all got a good laugh out of it the next day, and the fact they were all standing at 0500 not even fucking hung over as I wretchedly clung onto some form of sobriety and strangely not feeling the subzero weather since my senses were so dulled by the booze from the night prior. Lest to say these guys knew how to work hard and party hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As PLDC (WLC which it is called now) was ending I was getting ready to head back to my duty station, as we stood around \nwaiting in formation post Graduation I came up to one of the Russian Soldiers named Dima and gave him our Battalion \nCoin that the Lt. Colonel had given to me a few months back after our redeployment back to Germany after Iraq. We shook hands and hugged it out, I told him how much we \nappreciated their handwork, willingness to work with us and overcoming the language barriers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dima stood there for a second and looked me in the eye and said &amp;quot;I wish my wife and friends could see this, you guys are good people, a lot of people back home give you flack but not everyone understands a soldiers world or life, our life, sometimes we do things that other people will judge us harshly on even though we are carrying out our orders....Thank you.&amp;quot; As I shook his hand his last sentence gave me chills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope to god we never meet on a battlefield and we have too look at each other down the scope of a rifle&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kinda stood there, dumbfounded, unsure what to say, I slowly nodded and said &amp;quot;I hope to god that does not happen either Dima&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 9 years later and I think and wonder if Dima is alive, if his daughter is now almost 9 and if she is old enough to understand what she sees on tv and hears about from others, and if his wife is well. Does he and the other soldiers I trained with believe in what they are doing is right or wrong? Are they alive? Are they dead? Do they look back at the unfiltered unbiased interaction we had almost 9 years ago or do they fall back on the propaganda that is spun by the Kremlin....I guess I will never know. But I wanted both sides of the conflict to know that irregardless its people like Dima, like myself, and others on the UA that burden the entire load of this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right, wrong, I want people to look at both sides and see the humanity behind it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I as much as anyone want this fighting to stop, I want both sides of my family to stop dying for it. Both Ukrop and Katzap as we call each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Grandmother Who is Ukrainian told me when I asked her what does she think of the overall situation in Eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her reply was &amp;quot;\u043b\u0435\u0441 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u044f\u0442, \u0449\u0435\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0442&amp;quot;. The best translation is &amp;quot;Wood is being cut, Splinters are flying&amp;quot; meaning at this point with both sides not willing to back down they both lost sight of civilian casualties, the refugee issue, destruction of entire cities and infrastructure, basically once you start, you cannot stop because you are already committed to the cause and have sacrificed more then enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About seven years back on my last tour to Iraq at the height of the Troop surge in 2007 when it was Sunni versus Shi&amp;#39;a, Neighbor versus Neighbor, neighborhood versus Neighborhood I looked at my Iraqi interpreter after a patrol we had comeback from, we had discovered a detonated house with an Iraqi Sunni family in it, Father, Mother and small child, blown to hell while inside by a Shi&amp;#39;a militia group hellbent on making them leave the neighborhood since they were the last Sunni family living there. I finally stopped, it was hot as hell outside, this was the third instance I had seen myself of a forced eviction and or killing of a family, at this point I was barely able to contain my anger and frustration  &amp;quot;Why the fuck are you guys killing each other? over what? Because you pray differently? because he is sunni and he is shi&amp;#39;a?! When will this killing stop!?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My terp took a long drag of his parliaments cigarette and replied back sitting down &amp;quot;Unfortunately my countrymen will keep on killing until we realize we are tired of killing each other, that we have much more in common tradition wise that was suppressed under Saddams regime then our differences, until we get tired of killing, it won&amp;#39;t stop&amp;quot;. For living in a country that has been at war since 2001 which is nearly half of my lifetime I can say after a while you almost become numb to it, and this is what scares me is that this will keep on going with no end in sight, first hand seat to hell unfolding in a western nation while conflict becomes the status quo and norm in eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Conflict has made it very easy to dehumanize both sides, when you cannot sympathize with the enemy and are able to relegate them to nothing more then a object of hatred whether it is based on fact or lies it becomes that much easier to justify ones means to an end and vice-a-versa and it is the select few at the top that are held responsible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the pro-Russians and people being trolls that think this is a pro-ruskie propaganda piece, put your boners away you can try your best spin on it, it wont work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the Ukrainians that want to down-vote me into oblivion, I hope you realize the neutrality of this article and see &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;for what it is.

Besides my joint Ukrainian and Russian background I wanted both sides to see a different point of view of things.\n\nThis was February 2006, I just got sent to the NCO (Non Commissioned Officer) Academy as a Specialist in the U.S. Army\nFor those of you not familiar with our rank and promotion system once you become a Sergeant you are required to attend the NCO Academy either prior and or after attaining your Rank.\n\nBeing stationed In Germany I was given a choice to go early, I just picked up my Specialist rank and they apparently needed a translator for a contingent of Russian soldiers going through the training with us. \n\nThis was a kind of a exchange program of sorts to foster better relations. \n\nBefore I go on a little about me. Half Ukrainian Half Russian, I had emigrated to the states in the early 90's because of Chernobyl, I was born in Kiev originally and left the country when I was just 7 years old. My parents were both school teachers so I can read, speak, write Russian and Ukrainian fluently to this day. \n\nGrowing up in the American mid-west I enlisted right after 9/11 for all the hooah patriotic reasons my young teenage mind could come up with and actually got my American Citizenship via the US Army.\n\nAnyhow moving on.\n\nWe met the Russian soldiers near one of the installations Post Exchange shops at Grafenw\u00f6hr Germany. it was very snowy out and cold, but not too cold, I had my Army winter Fleece on and snivel gear, while the new arrivals were wearing and I hate to say it \"Stereotypical\" Eastern European outfit of either black jeans or dress pants, pointed leather shoes, and a leather jacket, -10C weather be damned. They were there to buy our PT Training uniforms for next days formation. It was the epitome of \"East meets West\" silent gazes abound.\n\n\nI broke the ice by asking in English if they can speak it. A few nodded yes, I then asked in crisp clear Russian if I could \ntranslate for them, a few surprised and shocked smiles peeked out. They realized since my last name ended in -enko on my name tape that I was Ukrainian, the Hohol jokes came forth but in a good natured way, they were impressed by my perfect Russian, and I \njokingly replied that I was busy trying to fit in to American Culture so i could debrief our KGB overlords back home, we all burst out laughing, things were off to a good start.\n\nFast forward a few hours later we were showing them the dining facility (Grafenw\u00f6hr Germany has THE FUCKING BEST Chow \nhall I have been too at the NCO academy.) The look on their faces when they came in and saw all of the fresh produce, \nfruit, vegetables and meat in the middle of winter for the taking. \nOne guy sheepishly asked if he could take an orange \nback with him, I told him why not, he can grab seconds too if he wanted. It definitely made me realize looking back seeing my parents and grandparents literally break down and cry the first time they went to a Supermarket back in America when we came stateside in the winter and seeing, fresh food, and meat and fruits, hell I didn't even know what a goddamn Pineapple looked like until I saw one as a kid after coming to America.\n\nA lot of these guys were volunteers under contract, not some of the regular conscript forces that get drafted up, these guys were Airborne Troops as well, mostly Infantry while the mix of soldiers at our NCO academy had everyone from a cook, to an Intel guy and a few combat arms specialties.\n\nAs the weeks went by I was able to say this, these guys were very professional, courteous, eager and willing to learn in the class room and out in the field. Yeah we had a few dick measuring contests of M1A1 Abrams vs the Soviet Tanks and Armor, and who has the better Jets, and firepower and weaponry but it was always with respect and humility. I recall discussing deployment stories of myself in Iraq and having to deal with Suicide bombers, some female, and having the Russian soldiers relate some pretty damn gritty war stories from Chechnya and having to deal with Muslim \nExtremists, a story of how one of their soldiers had both of his legs blown off by a landmine in a farmers field and \nhow their former PL ordered retribution by killing all of the Chechen sympathizers livestock and farm animals. Or how \nthey cornered a female Chechen sniper that ended up detonating herself as they approached her position in a high-rise building and how the soldier was covered in body parts and flesh and pieces of rubble. \n\nThese guys went through the same gritty in your face combat that I had just a year prior.\n\nIt made me realize these guys have girlfriends, lovers, spouses, kids and parents at home that worry about them.\nThey try to make ends meet, not knowing when and where they will go too into harms way. \n\nMost of them made a quarter of the money I made and were able to still eek out a living. At that point in time I never thought 9 years later that they would be at war with the country I emigrated from.\n\nWhen January 7th Rolled around it was the first time I was able to celebrate Orthodox Christmas with others of my religion for the first time in years, (Usually when deployed I wouldn't even bother, couldn't get a chaplain out to where we were let alone a East Orthodox Christian one) it was nice just recalling some of the Russian traditions from my dads side of the family.\n\nI remembered going out and buying a trinket and toy for one of the soldiers who's wife was pregnant back home, the \nlook of surprise, and sheer joy on his face I will forever hold onto to this day. It was pure unadulterated happiness.\nWe got so hammered one evening with one of the actual Instructors from School it was right after New years and we went \nand got the Smirnoff Bottle at one of the German Shops, it was so fucking huge it had an actual Pump up top. Long \nstory short, Russians + Vodka = Tall tales of exploits to be had. By 0200 the American Instructor was so shit faced I had to stop drinking to make sure that I wouldn't pass out so I could monitor his breathing, while the Russians \ncarefully carried his limp body onto his cot while another guy tried in hilarious broken English tell the Soldiers \nwife that he was just Drunk and sleeping it off as she kept buzzing his cellphone over and over again. \"No Madam I said he iz Draunk, da, he iz as we say bohoi\". We all got a good laugh out of it the next day, and the fact they were all standing at 0500 not even fucking hung over as I wretchedly clung onto some form of sobriety and strangely not feeling the subzero weather since my senses were so dulled by the booze from the night prior. Lest to say these guys knew how to work hard and party hard.\n\nAs PLDC (WLC which it is called now) was ending I was getting ready to head back to my duty station, as we stood around \nwaiting in formation post Graduation I came up to one of the Russian Soldiers named Dima and gave him our Battalion \nCoin that the Lt. Colonel had given to me a few months back after our redeployment back to Germany after Iraq. We shook hands and hugged it out, I told him how much we \nappreciated their handwork, willingness to work with us and overcoming the language barriers. \n\nDima stood there for a second and looked me in the eye and said \"I wish my wife and friends could see this, you guys are good people, a lot of people back home give you flack but not everyone understands a soldiers world or life, our life, sometimes we do things that other people will judge us harshly on even though we are carrying out our orders....Thank you.\" As I shook his hand his last sentence gave me chills.\n\n\"I hope to god we never meet on a battlefield and we have too look at each other down the scope of a rifle\". \n\nI kinda stood there, dumbfounded, unsure what to say, I slowly nodded and said \"I hope to god that does not happen either Dima\".\n\nFast forward 9 years later and I think and wonder if Dima is alive, if his daughter is now almost 9 and if she is old enough to understand what she sees on tv and hears about from others, and if his wife is well. Does he and the other soldiers I trained with believe in what they are doing is right or wrong? Are they alive? Are they dead? Do they look back at the unfiltered unbiased interaction we had almost 9 years ago or do they fall back on the propaganda that is spun by the Kremlin....I guess I will never know. But I wanted both sides of the conflict to know that irregardless its people like Dima, like myself, and others on the UA that burden the entire load of this conflict.\n\nRight, wrong, I want people to look at both sides and see the humanity behind it.\n\nI as much as anyone want this fighting to stop, I want both sides of my family to stop dying for it. Both Ukrop and Katzap as we call each other.\n\nMy Grandmother Who is Ukrainian told me when I asked her what does she think of the overall situation in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nHer reply was \"\u043b\u0435\u0441 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u044f\u0442, \u0449\u0435\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0442\". The best translation is \"Wood is being cut, Splinters are flying\" meaning at this point with both sides not willing to back down they both lost sight of civilian casualties, the refugee issue, destruction of entire cities and infrastructure, basically once you start, you cannot stop because you are already committed to the cause and have sacrificed more then enough.\n\nAbout seven years back on my last tour to Iraq at the height of the Troop surge in 2007 when it was Sunni versus Shi'a, Neighbor versus Neighbor, neighborhood versus Neighborhood I looked at my Iraqi interpreter after a patrol we had comeback from, we had discovered a detonated house with an Iraqi Sunni family in it, Father, Mother and small child, blown to hell while inside by a Shi'a militia group hellbent on making them leave the neighborhood since they were the last Sunni family living there. I finally stopped, it was hot as hell outside, this was the third instance I had seen myself of a forced eviction and or killing of a family, at this point I was barely able to contain my anger and frustration  \"Why the fuck are you guys killing each other? over what? Because you pray differently? because he is sunni and he is shi'a?! When will this killing stop!?\"\n\nMy terp took a long drag of his parliaments cigarette and replied back sitting down \"Unfortunately my countrymen will keep on killing until we realize we are tired of killing each other, that we have much more in common tradition wise that was suppressed under Saddams regime then our differences, until we get tired of killing, it won't stop\". For living in a country that has been at war since 2001 which is nearly half of my lifetime I can say after a while you almost become numb to it, and this is what scares me is that this will keep on going with no end in sight, first hand seat to hell unfolding in a western nation while conflict becomes the status quo and norm in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThis Conflict has made it very easy to dehumanize both sides, when you cannot sympathize with the enemy and are able to relegate them to nothing more then a object of hatred whether it is based on fact or lies it becomes that much easier to justify ones means to an end and vice-a-versa and it is the select few at the top that are held responsible.\n\nFor the pro-Russians and people being trolls that think this is a pro-ruskie propaganda piece, put your boners away you can try your best spin on it, it wont work.\n\nFor the Ukrainians that want to down-vote me into oblivion, I hope you realize the neutrality of this article and see \n\nfor what it is. A glimpse into the human side of things. I want this war to stop no more then you do.\n\n\n\nP.S.\n\nIll be glad to verify with a mod with a pic of my discharge papers if doubted about the veracity of my location and whereabouts.\n\n\nEdit: Thank for the reddit gold, honestly I feel like I don't deserve it especially in such a hotly contested topic so I do appreciate the kind gesture. \n\nEdit 2: Thank you for everyone's kind words and taking the time to read this giant wall of text and taking the article for what it is, a neutral attempt at seeing the conflict in a more humane way.\n\n\n", "likes": null, "user_reports": [],
